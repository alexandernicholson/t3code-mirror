# Settings and project overrides

On web and desktop, the "Applying settings for …" sentence at the top of Settings pages picks
the project and environment a change applies to. Pages that only hold device preferences, such as
Appearance, don't show it. They start at **All projects** and **All environments**
and stay selected as you move between categories or search for a setting.

Preferences saved on this device, such as appearance, confirmations and browser profiles, always
show and ignore the selection. Everything else is stored on a server. Choose one environment to
edit its settings, or leave **All environments** to edit every connected environment at once.
Offline environments keep their current values; this is a bulk edit, not a synced global default.

Choose a project to override settings for it on the selected environments. A layers icon beside
each server row's title shows where the value comes from: the built-in default, the environment,
or a project override. Click it to see that chain on every selected environment. An override can
be reset to inherit again. Settings that cannot be overridden by a project are shown read-only
while a project is selected.

When the selected environments disagree, the control shows **Mixed** in place of a value and the
layers icon turns amber. Picking a value applies it to every selected environment.

Changing an environment value never touches a project's own override. When projects override the
setting you are editing, the layers icon counts them and the chain lists each one with its value:
click a project to jump to it, or **Reset all** to make those projects follow the environment
again.

Providers and diagnostics are per machine: they show one environment at a time, the primary
one until you pick another. Every other setting fans out to the selection.

On mobile, open **Settings** and use the filter in its header to choose connected environments
and a project. The filter stays available in server-setting pages. With **All projects** selected,
the **Server settings** categories and auto-settle controls in **Thread behavior** edit the
selected environments' defaults. Choosing a project edits its overrides on the selected
environments. Use **Use defaults** in a page to remove that page's project overrides.
Open **Settings → Projects & threads → Overview** to rename the project across its selected
connected checkouts and see where those checkouts live.
Settings that are environment-wide stay read-only while a project is selected. When selected
targets disagree, a control shows **Mixed** until you choose one value. Appearance, keyboard,
and other phone-only settings ignore the filter.

## Defaults and inheritance

General contains the model and workspace for new threads. Integrations controls agent browser
access. Source Control contains automatic pull, the default pull request merge method and text
generation. The same rows edit environment defaults or project overrides depending on the
project crumb.

The Project category, shown while a project is selected, holds the project's name, icon, actions,
checkouts and removal. Actions belong to a project: editing them creates the project's own list
on each selected environment, and reset returns to the environment's shared list. A project's
`t3.json` actions can be imported there.

Settings a repository can also declare in `t3.json`, such as the workspace for new threads,
resolve in one order: a project override, then the environment setting, then `t3.json`, then the
built-in default. Leave a setting on **Inherit** to let the next tier decide.
Browser access changes apply when an agent session next starts.

New worktrees initialize git submodules recursively. If that step is slow because the repository
declares many nested submodules, set **Submodules** in **Settings → General** (with the project
selected to override it there) to **Top level only** to stop at the ones the repository declares
itself, or **Skip** to leave them for a setup script. It resolves in the same order as the
workspace default: a `"worktreeSubmodules"` value in the `t3.json` of the branch being checked out
applies when the project and environment are both on **Inherit**.

## Storage cleanup

Open **Settings → Storage** to enable automatic cleanup on one machine or all connected
environments. Policies are off by default and run on the server at startup, when changed, and
hourly. Offline machines keep their existing policies.

Select a project to set **Automatic worktree cleanup** to **Inherit**, **Off**, or **Custom**.
Inherit follows each machine's rules; Off keeps that project's worktrees until you remove them
manually. Custom applies separate worktree rules to the selected project or checkout. Browser
captures and log retention remain machine-wide.

Worktrees can be removed after a chosen number of inactive days, after merging, or when they
have no commits beyond the default branch. Only T3-managed worktrees are eligible. Active
sessions, shared worktrees, uncommitted changes, and ignored files other than `node_modules`
prevent removal. Branches and thread history stay; starting another turn recreates the checkout.
Merge cleanup requires the commits to be included in the remote default branch, so squash merges
may need the inactivity rule instead.

Enable **Delete worktrees with deleted threads** to remove safe worktrees after their last
thread is deleted, including archived threads and worktrees left by earlier deletions. The
server waits for sessions and terminals to stop and retries skipped worktrees after restart.
Existing prompts for deleting a worktree manually remain available when this policy is off.

Browser captures and rotated logs have separate retention periods. Expired capture links stop
working. Current logs, message attachments, and browser profiles are kept.

## Project icons

Select the project and open Project to choose an icon, emoji, monogram, or image. The choice applies to
every checkout in the project group and appears on connected clients. Choose **Automatic** to let
T3 Code detect an icon again.

Choose **Monogram** in the icon picker to set one or two letters or numbers and a color.

When no image is found, web and desktop show a two-character monogram with a color
from the icon palette, derived from the saved project name. For example, `Nebula` becomes `NA`,
`Silver Orchard` becomes `SO`, and `M7 Forge` becomes `M7`.

## Conversation backgrounds

Select the project and open Project to choose a built-in conversation background or upload your
own. Photos, including HEIC and HEIF images from phones, are converted and resized automatically.
GIF, animated WebP, and animated PNG uploads keep their animation. The background is stored on the
selected environment and appears in web, desktop, and mobile conversations for that project.

Reset the conversation background to remove the custom image and return to the standard canvas.

## Keep the default branch current

In Source Control, enable **Automatically pull** to keep the default-branch checkout up to date
with its configured upstream. Choose an environment to set the default or a project to override it.
On mobile, use **Settings → Source control** to change selected environment defaults or project overrides.

T3 Code only pulls when it can fast-forward and the checkout has no changed files, untracked files,
or local commits. It skips checkouts on another branch or without an upstream. If a checkout has
local work, resolve it yourself before automatic pulls can resume.

## Tools and MCP servers

The **Code tools** section manages language-server installation, custom servers, and code checks for each environment, project, or thread. See [Code tools](./code-tools.md) for setup and project rules.

In web or desktop, open **Settings → Tools & MCP servers**, choose an environment, and add
an HTTP server or a local command. Choose which providers and projects can use it. Local
commands run on the environment's machine. These tools are available to its conversations
from web, desktop, and mobile.

For credentials, set a secret environment variable in **Settings → Providers**, then reference
its name in the MCP server configuration. Changes, including disabling or removing a server,
apply when a provider session next starts or restarts; existing sessions keep their tools.

T3-managed servers support Codex, Claude, Cursor, Grok, and Antigravity. OpenCode, OAuth setup,
and servers configured directly in a provider remain managed through that provider.

## Secrets

Open **Settings → Secrets**, choose an environment, and add a key and value. Choose
**Environment-wide** to share it across projects, or select a project to limit access to
that project's agents. The same key can exist in both scopes. Ask your agent to store or
retrieve a secret and specify its scope.

Mark a secret **Highly sensitive** to require approval before retrieval. In chat, choose
**Allow once**, **Allow for thread**, or **Deny**. Approval shares the value with the agent
and its provider. You can revoke thread access from chat; updating or deleting the secret,
or restarting the environment, also clears that access. Agents cannot lower a secret's
sensitivity. Use Settings to change it or replace a stored value.

Values stay on the selected environment and are not displayed in Settings. Local storage
uses restricted file permissions, without encryption at rest. Approval controls access
through T3's secret tools; it does not isolate secrets from programs with filesystem access
on that machine. Bitwarden and 1Password are not connected yet.
